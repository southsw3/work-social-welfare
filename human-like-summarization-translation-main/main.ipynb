      "우리는 주의 메커니즘만을 기반으로 하는 새로운 간단한 네트워크 아키텍처인 트랜스포머를 제안한다. 두 가지 기계 번역 작업에 대한 실험은 이러한 모델이 품질 면에서 우수하면서도 병렬화가 더 가능하고 교육하는 데 훨씬 적은 시간이 필요하다는 것을 보여준다. Transformer는 훨씬 더 많은 병렬화를 가능하게 하며 8개의 P100 GPU에서 12시간 정도 교육을 받은 후 번역 품질에서 새로운 최첨단 기술에 도달할 수 있습니다. 순차 연산을 줄이는 목표는 확장 신경 GPU[16], ByteNet[18] 및 ConvS2S의 기초를 형성한다.\n"
